# FDF


FDF is a 42 Project to learn about 3d programming. The program takes a map as parameter and creates its 3d representation.
* Render a 3D map from a 2D representation.
* You can rotate, increase altitude coefficient and zoom in/out.

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run it with `./fdf [map]`. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the `maps`
directory.
